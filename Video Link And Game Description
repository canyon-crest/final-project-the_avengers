Game Description and Special Features:
Our game is called Pocket 2k and it's a 1-2 player basketball game with several modifiers to spice up the game and make it a new experience every time you play. 
These modifiers include modes like SniperShots (giving you extra range on all your shots), RandomHoops (the hoops change height every time you make a shot), and SuddenDeath (one basket wins the game)
You can play against either an AI, or against another player

How To Play Instructions: 
Disclaimer. Depending on the computer you're using, you may need to tab out and tab back into the game to be able to use WASD/arrow keys.

For player 1, you use W to jump up, A to move to the left, D to move to the right, and hold down S to power your shot. The longer you hold S, the more power your shot will have, and releasing S will shoot the ball.

For player 2, you use arrow keys as replacements. UP instead of W, LEFT instead of A, RIGHT instead of D, and DOWN instead of S. 

If you jump and intercept the ball as it is moving upward (after the other player shoots) you will block the shot and gain possesion. If you jump up and land down, the ball will automatically shoot with a set power, 
as that counts as a travel. You cannot take the ball out of the air as it is coming downward, because that would be goaltending. 

Hope you have fun playing against the CPU! (don't be discouraged if it beats you, it's quite skilled)
